*  @class LXDMXWiFi
*  @abstract
*     LXDMXWiFi encapsulates functionality for sending and receiving DMX over WiFi.
*     It is a virtual class with concrete subclasses LXWiFiArtNet and LXWiFiSACN which specifically
*     implement the Artistic Licence Art-Net and PLASA sACN 1.31 protocols.
*     
*     Note:  LXDMXWiFi_library requires WiFiUdp 
*            included with the ESP8266 Arduino package.
*
*            Note:  For sending packets larger than 512 bytes, ESP8266 WiFi Library v2.1
*            is required.
